# iprog-project-myfavedb

## Short description
A application in which users can create their own top movie-list and view others. In other words, kind of similar to creating your own playlists in Spotify, but here you can create your own lists of favorite movies deciding the title yourself, for example “My top 10 Horror Movies”, “Best five movies with Tom Hanks” etc. Users also have their own profile page where they can add some trivia, for example personal favorite genres, best movie of all time etc.

## What you have done?
We have focused on getting the API to work. Therefore is the functionality not done. We haven't made all pages yet either. 

## What you still plan to do
We are planning to do the rest of the missing pages. Create our database with user datas and fix cookies. We need to create the function to save lists and sort them.
